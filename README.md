Ubercart signup integration for Drupal 7
========================================

This is not the a port of the uc_signup module located on drupal.org. This module takes a significantly different approach to integration.

Configuration
-------------

Once the module is installed, you need only enable signups on an ubercart product. The module does the rest.

You may also want to edit the signup views to add some links to the orders associated with individual signups.
