Ubercart signup integration for Drupal 7
========================================

This is not the a port of the [uc_signup module on drupal.org](http://drupal.org/project/uc_signup). This module takes a significantly different approach to integration. I am waiting to hear back from the Drupal 6 uc_signup module's maitainer before publishing this module to drupal.org, possibly under another name.

Configuration
-------------

Once the module is installed, you need only enable signups on an ubercart product. The module does the rest.

You may also want to edit the signup views to add some links to the orders associated with individual signups.
